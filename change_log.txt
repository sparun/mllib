-----------------------------------------
29-08-2021 VERSION 5.3 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix/Search
	- calTiming.m now sends a vector of X and Y values (dva) for all calibration points shown using trl.picPosShift in trial Footer
	- ml_loadEvents.m includes trl.picPosShift to enable encoding and decoding of dva values to precision of 3 decimal places between (-50 to 50 dva range), see within file for instructions

04-03-2021 VERSION 5.2 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix/Search
	- updated all iscan cfg files for didi and juju

21-02-2021 VERSION 5.1 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix/Search
	- templateSearch update to 3*3 array
	- all timing files updated to send TrialRecord to fillDashboard
	- Comments updated in all timings files
	- fillDashboard cleaned and updated to take TrialRecord as second input (instead of TrialRecord.User)
	- update cfg for and ml in each template to default monkeylogic_cfg2.mat (saved with all hardware settings as being used)
	- update latest iscan cfg (didi updated) and all renamed to 'monkeynameDate'.	

	mlLib
	- ml_makeConditionsSearch - now 3*3 array, 1 target and 8 distractors from td pairs.

11-02-2021 VERSION 5.0 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix/Search
	- templateSearch code added for present absent visual search (using templateSD as base)
	- test period is essentiall the search period and consequently there is no sample period
	- calTiming.m has an additional editable ('taskStimRadius') over the regular calTiming.m

	mlLib
	- ml_makeConditionsSearch - 1 target and 3 distractors from td pairs. hold and resp buttons pink and x-pos is 25 dva (was 20dva in templateSD)
	- ml_initExp - updated monkey names to include chacha and cocochacha in error message

-----------------------------------------

05-01-2021 VERSION 4.3 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix
	- calTiming.m/fixTiming.m - rectified further error in inability to deal with error on fixation after last stim
	- correct outcome is assigned if outcome value hasn't be assigned as greater than -1 by the end of while loop
	- NaN values initiated to max required size
	- event names for stimuli in fixTiming updated to match with ml_loadEvents	
	- expSetup.m for templateFixation updated to assign blocks

	mlLib
	- ml_loadEvents - eventmarker for stimuli in fixTiming updated to stim1On/stim1Off etc. (instead of fix1On/fix2On)
	- ml_makeConditionsFix - deal with conditions less than 6

01-01-2021 VERSION 4.2 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix
	- calTiming.m/fixTiming.m - error in some calib trials with missing events and erroneous fixation on 4th point rewarded is rectified
	- 'outcome' variable was being reassigned within the while loop in calTiming.m
	- an additional check to ensure correct number of stimuli (in both cal and fix timing) are fixated on is done now

31-12-2020 VERSION 4.1 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix
	- editable variables renamed
	- fixTiming.m updated to handle delayPeriod of 0 ms
	- fixed fixation hold period (after fix init) implemented (set at 200ms) across timing files
	- updated variable names in info field and in timing files (holdInitPeriod and fixInitPeriod)

01-12-2020 VERSION 4.0 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix
	- calibration editable variables separated from task (sd or fix) editable variables
	- corrected missing editable start event marker in calTiming.m
	- update time function for trialStart and trialStop to 'datestr(now)' from clock (as millisecond precision wasn't there)
	- added latest iscan dqw cfg files
	
	mlLib
	- ml_initExp - updated PC name to 'VISIONLABML', corrected error message for header not sent
	- ml_readSerialData - update time function to 'datestr(now)' from clock (as millisecond precision wasn't there)

-----------------------------------------

01-11-2020 VERSION 3.2 thomas/arun/jhilik
	templateSD/Fix
	- added trialFlag in TrialRecord.User for cal, fix and sd (NaN in cal trials).
	- added condition of free choice trial in sd timing so monkey gets reward if Info.expectedResponse is 0.

	mlLib
	- ml_alertFunction - added comment about serial data saving at 'trial end'
	- ml_makeCondiditonsFix - changed color of hold button from green to blue

31-10-2020 VERSION 3.1 thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix
	- corrected missing calib and fix image number event markers in fixTiming and calTiming files. cfg2 file in templateFix updates to check 
	  blockChange updates also (no significant change to other params).

	mlLib	
	- ml_blockChange - corrected instance of calib block not being removed from TrialRecord.User.blockList so that it's not played automatically
	- ml_alertFunction - added a serialport read before callback initiation to read and discard erroneous data. Also serialdata is now converted 
	  to double before being saved into TrialRecord.User.serialData (this is now a fast operation)	 

29-10-2020 VERSION 3.0 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix
	- brought fixation template to sd template version (requisite codes and such)
	- common calTIming.m across both templates (fix and sd) - as the editables are same between both tasks (even within a task,
	  timing files should have common editables)
	- simple fillDashboard.m for fixation tempalte that only shows editable variables and juice consumed

	mlLib	
	- ml_makeConditionsFix/SD - updated theses and removed redundant info values and rearranged all vis stimuli to be come after
	  ptd,hold,fix,calib,audCorr and audIncorr so as to have commonality between calib files.
	- ml_alert_function - removed encoding of serial data string to numbers as it added overhead in ITI. Now serial data collected
	  in trial is directly dumped into TrialRecord.User.serialData{trialNum}
	- ml_blockChange - checked and verified that it now selects the previous non calib block even if calib block was successively
	  called twice manually. Will repeat the prior block in full, so ideally load calib block after a block has just ended.

-----------------------------------------

22-10-2020 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD
	- packing following editable variable into trial footer using start stop and shift markers (trl.edtStart..etc)
		- goodPause - badPause - fixRadius - fixPeriod - calHoldPeriod - rewardVol (*1000, hence will be in microlitres)
	- added check.linesEven before trl.start and check.linesOdd after trl.stop eventmarkers. Good visual marker on OEP lfp viewer
	- photodiode cue now simply flips state at every visual event in the trial (turned off at beginning and end of trial)
	- photodiode signal is now in analog mode instead of digital due to iffy reliability in digtial mode
	- updated fillDashboard.m to calculate and display errors correctly and differentiate type of error, removed weighted accuracy
	- audio files now located in folder 'aud' instead of ambiguous 'dep'
	- added config files from iscan(DQW settings), oep(Channel config) and ml(cfg2.mat) into folder 'cfg'

	mlLib	
	- ml_mlconcatenate: modified few lines(commented within) which gave error for touchpoints being NaN
	- ml_loadEvents: added start stop and shift markers for editable variables and changed ascii shift from 10000 to 200000
	- Added descriptions and comments for all functions in lib
	- Removed unneccessary/deprecated functions

-----------------------------------------

15-10-2020 VERSION 1.0 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD
	- removed dependency on legacy iscan serial code
	- noe use MATLABs own serialport function (always add default file to top of path as ML also has similarly named function)
	- updated calibration timing file to have cal point acquire time and hodl time as editable vars
	- cleared up timing code text (removed sections and unwanted variables)
	- new eye calib settings as juice spout and touchscreen height increased by ~2.5cm.
	- now there are individual monkeys dqw settings files for iscan also (eg: illumBelowTrackerAbovCoCo20201015.def)

	mlLib
	- ml_initExp: asks if netcam auto record is needed.
	- ml_startNetcamRecord, ml_stopNetcamRecord: requires watchtower to be on and cameras bound
	  starts and stops netcam record remotely and makes appropriate folder to save files in (E:\series4\expFolder\monkeyFolder\*.mp4)
	- ml_packHeader: corrected wrong variable name issue
	- ml_sendHeader: send bhv file name also	
	- ml_alert_function: updated to close serial port correctly on exp end (but any error in ML task requires MATLAB restart)
	- ml_loadEvents: added codes for bhvName start and stop
	- ml_makeConditionSD: increased fixation point size to 0.6dva from 0.3dva

-----------------------------------------

	templateSD 
	- corrected all rt's from eyejoytrack into time from trial start
	- incorporated a fixation maintenance period after fix acquire
	- removed any clampEye codes (will add later if needed)
	- still using legacy PsychtoolBox serialport funcs
	- copied cfg file from generalSDV_0.0 as that is latest

28-09-2020 VERSION 0.0 - thomas/georgin/zhivago/jhilik
	templateSD
	- used to retrain monkeys
	- clampeye disabled to check raw traces
	- no fixation maintenance after fix acquire
	- all eyejoytracks (other than for monkey choice) store rt
