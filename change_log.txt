25-12-2021 VERSION 6.1 - thomas/georgin
	Added decoding codes. 	
	createL1str: This is a common L1_str creation codes across tasks. This code will pool data from ML (.bhv2) file, wired eCube (.bin), and wireless eCube (.bin) files and create L1_str.   
	
	wmLib: White matter based library used in createL1str.
	- wm_spikeSortingThreshold.m : Basic threhsold based sorting. 
	- wm_readWirelessData.m      : Basic function to read the wireless data from . bin files. 
	- wm_readDigitalFiles.m      : Function to read the wired digital data from .bin files. 
	- wm_readAnalogFiles.m       : Function to read the analog data from .bin files. 
	- wm_headerUint16Double.m    : Internal subfunction used to decode header. 
	- wm_findWirelessStartTime.m : Function to extract the wireless start time wrt the wired eCube start time. 
	- wm_findNetcamStartTime.m   : Function to extract the netcam start time wrt the wired eCube start time.
	- wm_extractTrialEventsAndFooter.m: Function to extract the Trials events and Footer from Experiment Events.
	- wm_extractPhotodiodeEventTimes.m : Function to extract photodiode signal. This function returns time high-to-low and low-to-high transition times based on respective thresholds.  
	- wm_extractExpEventsAndHeader.m   : Function to extract experiment events and header from the digital data. 
	- wm_extractDigitalBits.m     : subFunction to extract the individual bits. 
	- wm_ecubeProperties.m        : Function to store the eCube hardware related parameters.

18-11-2021 VERSION 6.0 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix/Search
	- all timing files now include eventmarker indicating task in trial footer
    - expSetup in each templateExp now updated as fixSetup/sdSetip/searchSetup etc. and
      includes verbose comments about what the code does.
    - sdTiming.m updated to deal with delayPeriod == 0 and also with testOff ~= respPeriod. 
      A new variable visibleStims is used to keep track of stimuli visible on screen (except ptd).
	  This is useful to turn off only stimuli visible on outcome and to keep a separate ptd off 
      toggleobject at end of trials. Reworked trial end to happen after reward and associated pauses.
	  Included stimFixCue as TaskObject.
	- calTiming.m calib point is now 0.5 dva radius and timing/variables updated to be similar
      to sdTiming.m. Adjusted task objects pointers as wmFixCue is a new TaskObject in conditions file.
    - fixTiming.m and searchTiming.m updated to latest spec (in spirit of sdTiming)
    - stimuli ID and position is sent in all timing files as triads of ID,xPos and yPos (pos in DVA).
    - photodiode signal in ML is collected in General Input 2 channel (some wierd bug with PhotoDiode assignment)
    - Stimuli durations on screen are enabled with scanline threshold at 0 (to be done in photodiode tuner tool)
    - this version works with ML version 2.2.20 (Jaewons first updates, find in X:\software\mlpc\monkeylogic)
    	
	mlLib   
    - ml_makeConditionsSD.m fix size is now 0.1 dva radius and full yellow circle. Hold and response
      buttons color is now dark green (rgb = [0 0.33 0]), included wmFixCue as TaskObject and wmFixCueState as input.
	- ml_makeConditionsSearch.m/ml_makeConditionsFix.m updated to latest spec - changes similar to makeConditionsSD.
	- ml_alertFunction.m now clears serialport object iScan upon any error in timing file. No need to restart MATLAB each time.
	- ml_loadEvents.m added a value for NaN (exp.nan = 999) and a value for response made in task (bhv.respGiven)
	- ml_loadEvents.m added events to indicated type of task (trl.taskXXXX)
    - ml_alertFucntion.m includes an error in case scanline threshold for task isn't set as 0. Task will quit.
      Please set scanline threshold as 0 in photodiode tuner tool.
    - all ml_xxx functions updated to have comments to describe functionality

	mlLib
	- ml_alertFunction - added comment about serial data saving at 'trial end'
	- ml_makeCondiditonsFix - changed color of hold button from green to blue

31-10-2020 VERSION 3.1 thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix
	- corrected missing calib and fix image number event markers in fixTiming and calTiming files. cfg2 file in templateFix updates to check 
	  blockChange updates also (no significant change to other params).

	mlLib	
	- ml_blockChange - corrected instance of calib block not being removed from TrialRecord.User.blockList so that it's not played automatically
	- ml_alertFunction - added a serialport read before callback initiation to read and discard erroneous data. Also serialdata is now converted 
	  to double before being saved into TrialRecord.User.serialData (this is now a fast operation)	 

29-10-2020 VERSION 3.0 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD/Fix
	- brought fixation template to sd template version (requisite codes and such)
	- common calTIming.m across both templates (fix and sd) - as the editables are same between both tasks (even within a task,
	  timing files should have common editables)
	- simple fillDashboard.m for fixation tempalte that only shows editable variables and juice consumed

	mlLib	
	- ml_makeConditionsFix/SD - updated theses and removed redundant info values and rearranged all vis stimuli to be come after
	  ptd,hold,fix,calib,audCorr and audIncorr so as to have commonality between calib files.
	- ml_alert_function - removed encoding of serial data string to numbers as it added overhead in ITI. Now serial data collected
	  in trial is directly dumped into TrialRecord.User.serialData{trialNum}
	- ml_blockChange - checked and verified that it now selects the previous non calib block even if calib block was successively
	  called twice manually. Will repeat the prior block in full, so ideally load calib block after a block has just ended.

-----------------------------------------

22-10-2020 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD
	- packing following editable variable into trial footer using start stop and shift markers (trl.edtStart..etc)
		- goodPause - badPause - fixRadius - fixPeriod - calHoldPeriod - rewardVol (*1000, hence will be in microlitres)
	- added check.linesEven before trl.start and check.linesOdd after trl.stop eventmarkers. Good visual marker on OEP lfp viewer
	- photodiode cue now simply flips state at every visual event in the trial (turned off at beginning and end of trial)
	- photodiode signal is now in analog mode instead of digital due to iffy reliability in digtial mode
	- updated fillDashboard.m to calculate and display errors correctly and differentiate type of error, removed weighted accuracy
	- audio files now located in folder 'aud' instead of ambiguous 'dep'
	- added config files from iscan(DQW settings), oep(Channel config) and ml(cfg2.mat) into folder 'cfg'

	mlLib	
	- ml_mlconcatenate: modified few lines(commented within) which gave error for touchpoints being NaN
	- ml_loadEvents: added start stop and shift markers for editable variables and changed ascii shift from 10000 to 200000

	- Removed unneccessary/deprecated functions

-----------------------------------------

15-10-2020 VERSION 1.0 - thomas/georgin
	templateSD

	- cleared up timing code text (removed sections and unwanted variables)
	- new eye calib settings as juice spout and touchscreen height increased by ~2.5cm.
	- now there are individual monkeys dqw settings files for iscan also (eg: illumBelowTrackerAbovCoCo20201015.def)

	mlLib
	- ml_initExp: asks if netcam auto record is needed.
	- ml_startNetcamRecord, ml_stopNetcamRecord: requires watchtower to be on and cameras bound
	  starts and stops netcam record remotely and makes appropriate folder to save files in (E:\series4\expFolder\monkeyFolder\*.mp4)
	- ml_packHeader: corrected wrong variable name issue
	- ml_sendHeader: send bhv file name also	
	- ml_alert_function: updated to close serial port correctly on exp end (but any error in ML task requires MATLAB restart)
	- ml_loadEvents: added codes for bhvName start and stop
	- ml_makeConditionSD: increased fixation point size to 0.6dva from 0.3dva
